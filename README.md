# "Private Data"  Project

This project demonstrates the fact that private data isn't really private since the ethereum network is public. The data can't be called, but it can be read. Hence, it's not really private anyways. This project comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
